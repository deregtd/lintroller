# This file contains tool versions for use with asdf
# Note: Versions in this block override the default versions below.
# Be EXTREMELY CAREFUL with this. If you override a standard version

## <<Stencil::Block(toolverOverride)>>
golang 1.23.0
nodejs 20.12.2
## <</Stencil::Block>>
# Note: Versions in this block do not override the default versions above
# but sometimes you have to declare additional versions of the same tool
# while leaving the 'default' version intact for the infra.
# The most common case is nodejs.
